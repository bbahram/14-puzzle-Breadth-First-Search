# Breadth-First Search to Solve 14-puzzle problem

The 14-puzzle problem is similar to the 15-puzzle problem, but it has one extra empty cell; the empty cells are indicated by zeros. This project tries to solve this problem by using Breadth-First Search.<br>
I left some initial forms of the problem as examples in the form of comments in the code.<br>
This project was written in 2020 and developed in Python, and is one of my academic projects.
